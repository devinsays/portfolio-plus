Instructions and Common Questions
---------------------------------

How to Set Up a Portfolio Item:

Portfolio Press requires the "Portfolio Post Type" plugin in order to use the portfolio functionality: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/portfolio-post-type/

To add the portfolio image, click "Set featured image" on the right side of the screen beneath "Portfolio Tags".  This will take you to the media uploader to add your image.  When you finish, click "Use as Featured Image".

Switching Themes:

If you want to switch themes, you will likely have trouble finding that fully supports portfolio post types.  If you feel comfortable editing a bit of code, you can install the Portfolio Post Type plugin and make your own archive-portfolio.php and single-portfolio template: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/portfolio-post-type/

Otherwise, you might want to switch your custom post types to regular posts or pages.  To do this, you can use this plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/convert-post-types/
