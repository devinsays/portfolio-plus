# Portfolio+

Portfolio+ is a responsive theme for showcasing your photography, art, web sites, or other projects.  It also works nicely as a regular blog site.  An options panel is included for uploading logos and and changing the layout.  There's also support for the image, gallery and quote post formats.  Visit the [demo site](http://themes.wptheming.com/portfolio-plus/) or [watch the video screencast](http://wptheming.com/portfolio-press) for set up instructions.

## Credits

WordPress projects always stand on the shoulders of others.  Please take this theme and build upon it for you own work!

Portfolio was built on the solid foundation of [Toolbox](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox).

Additional testing and code audits were done by [Michael Fields](http://wordpress.mfields.org/) and [Jake Goldman](https://twitter.com/jakemgold).
